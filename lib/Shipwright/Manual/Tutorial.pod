Shipwright::Manual::Tutorial - Shipwright tutorial

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In this tutorial, we'll create a vessel to demonstrate the basic operation of
Shipwright.

=head1 TUTORIAL

=head2 Introduction

Shipwright ships with command line tool F<shipwright> which allows you to
manage shipyard: L<create|/Create a new shipyard>,
L<import sources|/Import sources>, L</update>, and so on.

Let's start from a new shipyard.

=head3 Create a new shipyard

shipyard - the place where all source code lives.
Shipwright supports several backends: L<SVK|Shipwright::Backend::SVK>,
L<SVN|Shipwright::Backend::SVN>, L<Git|Shipwright::Backend::Git> and
L<plain file system|Shipwright::Backend::FS>.
We'll use FS in this tutorial.

Let's create a new shipyard:

    $ shipwright create -r fs:/tmp/foo

To avoid typing I<-r fs:/tmp/foo> all the time you can use "SHIPWRIGHT_SHIPYARD"
environment variable.

    $ export SHIPWRIGHT_SHIPYARD="fs:/tmp/foo"

From now on we don't need the "-r ..." for the session.

=head3 Import sources

Our shipyard is worthless if it doesn't contain any source, let's import some.

Shipwright supports various types of sources.
Here are some examples:

=over 4

=item compressed file

    file:/tmp/foo.tar.gz
    file:/home/ross/dinosaur-0.01.tar.bz2

=item plain directory

    dir:/tmp/foo
    directory:/home/ross/dinosaur-0.01

=item HTTP
    
    http://apache.mirror.phpchina.com/httpd/httpd-2.2.9.tar.gz
    http://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/packages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/C/CL/CLKAO/SVK-v2.0.2.tar.gz

=item FTP

    ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.4.9.tar.bz2
    ftp://ftp.cuhk.edu.hk/pub/packages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/C/CL/CLKAO/SVK-v2.0.2.tar.gz

=item SVK
    
    svk:/test/foo

=item SVN

    svn:file:///tmp/repo/foo
    svn:http://svn.example.com/foo

=item Git

    git:file:///tmp/foo.git

=item CPAN

    cpan:Jifty
    cpan:Module::Install

=item shipyard

    shipyard:fs:/tmp/shipyard/foo
    shipyard:fs:/tmp/shipyard/bar

fs:/tmp/shipyard is another shipyard, 'foo' or 'bar' is the
source name we want to import.

=back

We'll import apache 2.2.9, perl 5.10, mod_perl 2.0, libxml and XML::LibXML
in this tutorial one by one.

    $ shipwright import http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.2.9.tar.gz --name apache
    $ shipwright import http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/R/RG/RGARCIA/perl-5.10.0.tar.gz
    $ shipwright import http://perl.apache.org/dist/mod_perl-2.0-current.tar.gz --name mod_perl --no-follow
    ( use --no-follow is because run Makefile.PL will hung if we don't have
      apache installed )
    $ shipwright import ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/libxml2-2.6.32.tar.gz --name libxml
    $ shipwright import cpan:XML::LibXML

Run I<shipwright help import> to see more options.

As a side note, if we were importing from a source that doesn't use a build
mechanism that Shipwright can automatically create a set of build instructions
for (currently I<autoconf>, L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker>, L<Module::Install>, and 
L<Module::Build>), we would now need to edit F<scripts/SOURCE_NAME/build> to tell
Shipwright how to build that source.

For our tutorial, e.g. perl 5.10, Shipwright doesn't know about the
peculiarities of how to build perl, so we need to edit the build file:

  configure: ./Configure -des -Dprefix=%%INSTALL_BASE%%
  test: %%MAKE%% test
  install: %%MAKE%% install

For more information on build scripts, see L<Shipwright::Manual::CustomizeBuild>.

=head3 update

For dists with I<CPAN>, I<SVK>, I<SVN>, I<Git> and I<shipyard> types,
we can simply use the I<update> command to update:

    $ shipwright update cpan-XML-LibXML
    (yeah, that's right, cpan:XML::LibXML will be named cpan-XML-LibXML)

We can also specify the version we want to update to with --version argument:

    $ shipwright update cpan-XML-LibXML --version 1.60

For other types, Shipwright can't guess the latest version, so we have to tell
Shipwright where it is using the I<relocate> command.

e.g. apache 2.2.10 is released one day, with download link
L<http://apache.mirror.phpchina.com/httpd/httpd-2.2.10.tar.gz>, we need to 
set the source URL first before updating.

    $ shipwright relocate apache http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.2.10.tar.gz 
    $ shipwright update apache

=head3 tweak manually 

You may find that I<cpan-XML-LibXML> needs I<libxml> as a dependency, but
in F</scripts/cpan-XML-LibXML/require.yml> there's no such entry,
because F<require.yml> is created automatically, filled with perl module dists,
no extra dependences will be set.

So we need to do it manually, e.g. use the following command to do so:

    $ shipwright update cpan-XML-LibXML --add-deps libxml

=head3 build

We need to I<checkout> the repository into some directory first,
then I<chdir> there, and run:
(for FS backend, there's no need to checkout, just chdir to /tmp/foo ),

$ ./bin/shipwright-builder --install-base /tmp/vessel

Run I<./bin/shipwright-builder --help> to see more options and
I<./bin/shipwright-builder --advanced-help> to see even more options.

=head3 fiddle the vessel

We can use F<bin/shipwright-filter> to fiddle the vessel, e.g. removing pods.
Run I<./bin/shipwright-filter --help> to see more options

=head3 ship our vessel

We call the built source the I<vessel>.

To ship our vessel, create an archive of the built files using an archive
program such as I<tar>, e.g. by running I<tar czvf vessel.tar.gz
/tmp/vessel>.

Users can use our vessel by extracting the archive to a directory and then
adding the following command to their shell's startup script
(e.g. for bash users, edit F</home/user/.bashrc> on most systems): I<source
/base/path/tools/etc/shipwright-source-bash> (for bash users). A source script
is also provided for the tcsh shell. 

Here is a sourcing example:

  source /home/user/myapp/tools/shipwright-source-bash /home/user/myapp

This example assumes the myapp vessel was extracted to /home/user/myapp.
                                    
After sourcing this script, users will be able to run binaries and load perl
modules from our vessel as with normal installed programs, though they will 
need to start a new shell or re-run their startup script.


=head3 ship shipyard

If you want to ship a shipyard instead of the vessel, you can just tar your
shipyard( i.e. "/tmp/foo" ) and ship it, though Shipwright supplies a
convenient way too:

Let's chdir to our shipyard first, then run:
$ ./bin/shipwright-utility --generate-tar-file /tmp/shipyard.pl

The shipyard.pl is a shipyard perl script working like "shipwright-builder"
but it's self contained, so you can build a vessel with shipyard.pl like this:

$ perl /tmp/shipyard.pl --install-base /tmp/vessel
