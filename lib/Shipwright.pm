=head1 NAME

Shipwright - Best Practical Builder

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ export SHIPWRIGHT_SHIPYARD=fs:/tmp/fs
    $ shipwright create 
    # import will take a while, enjoy your coffee!
    $ shipwright import cpan:Jifty
    $ cd /tmp/fs
    $ ./bin/shipwright-builder --install-base /tmp/jifty

    one liner doing the same thing:
    $ shipwright-generate cpan:Jifty | perl - --install-base /tmp/jifty


=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Why use Shipwright?

Most software packages depend on other bits of software in order to avoid code
repetition. This may result in pain when attempting to install the software,
due to the maze of dependencies, especially for large projects with many
dependencies.

Shipwright is a tool to help you bundle your software with all its
dependencies, regardless of whether they are CPAN modules or non-Perl modules
from elsewhere. Shipwright makes the bundle work easy.

=head2 Introduction

If this is your first time using Shipwright, L<Shipwright::Manual::Tutorial> is
probably a better place to start.

=head2 Design

The idea of Shipwright is simple:

    sources                        shipwright factory
---------------------           ------------------------
|  all the separate |  import   |  shipyard             |  build
|  sources          |  =====>   |                       |  ====>
---------------------           ------------------------

     vessel (final product)
----------------------------------------------
| all packages installed with smart wrappers |
----------------------------------------------

=head2 What's in a shipyard

=head3 shipyard after initialization

After initializing a shipyard, the files in the repository are:

  bin/
      # used for building, installing and testing
      shipwright-builder
      # a utility for doing things such as updating the build order
      shipwright-utility

  etc/
      # wrapper for installed bin files, mainly for optimizing the environment
      shipwright-script-wrapper
      # wrapper for installed perl scripts
      shipwright-perl-wrapper
      # source files you can `source', for tcsh and bash, respectively.
      # both will be installed to tools/
      shipwright-source-tcsh, shipwright-source-bash
      # utility which will be installed to tools/
      shipwright-utility
      # set env bat for windows
      shipwright-windows-setenv.bat

  inc/ # modules for shipwright itself

  sources/      # all the sources live here

  scripts/    # all the build scripts and dependency hints live here

  shipwright/

      # branches note, see L<Shipwright::Manual::UsingBranches>
      branches.yml
      # flags note, see L<Shipwright::Manual::UsingFlags>
      flags.yml
      # test failures note
      known_test_failures.yml
      # cpan dists' module => name map
      map.yml
      # the actual build order
      order.yml
      # reference count note
      refs.yml
      # non-cpan dists' name => url map
      source.yml
      # sources' version
      version.yml

  t/
      # will run this if with --only-test when build
      test

=head3 shipyard after import

After importing, say cpan:Acme::Hello, both the sources and scripts directories
will have a `cpan-Acme-Hello' directory.

Under scripts/cpan-Acme-Hello there are two files: 'build' and 'require.yml'.

=head4 build

  configure: %%PERL%% %%MODULE_BUILD_BEFORE_BUILD_PL%% Build.PL --install_base=%%INSTALL_BASE%% --install_path lib=%%INSTALL_BASE%%/lib/perl5 --install_path arch=%%INSTALL_BASE%%/lib/perl5
  make: %%PERL%% %%MODULE_BUILD_BEFORE_BUILD%% Build
  test: %%PERL%% %%MODULE_BUILD_BEFORE_BUILD%% Build test
  install: %%PERL%% %%MODULE_BUILD_BEFORE_BUILD%% Build install
  clean: %%PERL%% %%MODULE_BUILD_BEFORE_BUILD%% Build realclean

Each line is of `type: command' format, and the command is executed line by
line (which is also true for t/test).

See L<Shipwright::Manual::CustomizeBuild> for more information on
customizing the build process for dists.

=head4 require.yml

  build_requires: {}
  
  conflicts: {}
  
  recommends:
    cpan-Locale-Maketext-Lexicon:
      version: 0.15
  requires: {}

This file details the hints needed in order for Shipwright to create the
right build order.

=head4 vessel

After the cmd C<./bin/shipwright-builder --install-base /tmp/vessel>,
we have a new directory structure which we call a I<vessel>(/tmp/vessel).
